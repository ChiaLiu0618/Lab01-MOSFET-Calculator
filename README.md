Supper MOSFET Calculator(SMC)
	Triode Mode: (𝑉𝐺𝑆−1>𝑉𝐷𝑆)
Current and Gain Calculation: 
𝐼𝐷=13⋅𝑊⋅(2(𝑉𝐺𝑆−1)𝑉𝐷𝑆−𝑉𝐷𝑆2)
𝑔𝑚=23⋅𝑊⋅𝑉𝐷𝑆
	Saturation mode: 𝑉𝐺𝑆−1≤𝑉𝐷𝑆
Current and Gain Calculation:
𝐼𝐷=13⋅𝑊⋅(𝑉𝐺𝑆−1)2
𝑔𝑚=23⋅𝑊⋅(𝑉𝐺𝑆−1) 

Step 1: Calculate Current or Gain for 6 Inputs
•  Observe the common factors: W, division by 3, and 𝑉GS−1𝑉_GS - 1VGS−1.
•  Optimize by factoring out common terms and deferring the division by 3 until after sorting.

Step 2: Sort 6 Results
Implemented with “6-input sorting network". 

Step 3: Compute Average
Use a multiplexer (MUX) to select either the top 3 or bottom 3 values.
	Current Calculation:
Top 3 : 𝐼𝑎𝑣𝑔=112⋅(3×𝑛0+4×𝑛1+5×𝑛2)
Bottom 3 : 𝐼𝑎𝑣𝑔=112⋅(3×𝑛3+4×𝑛4+5×𝑛5)
	Gain Calculation:
Top 3 : 𝑔𝑎𝑣𝑔=13⋅(𝑛0+𝑛1+𝑛2)
Bottom 3 : 𝑔𝑎𝑣𝑔=13⋅(𝑛3+𝑛4+𝑛5)

Key Learnings:
•	Factor out common operations to reduce hardware usage.
•	Delay costly operations like multiplication and division until necessary. E.g. The division can be postponed until after sorting, reducing the number of dividers from 6 (one for each input) to 3 (only for the sorted results).
•	You can use a Multiplexer to select operand A and operand B before performing multiplication. This approach helps to save one multiplier.
•	Multiplication optimized by the Design Compiler usually has better performance than trying to optimize it manually. Simplify logic to make it easier for the Design Compiler to optimize.
•	Avoid premature optimization in simple designs; focus on understanding the synthesis report.
•	You can replace dividers with a lookup table (case statement) to lower cell area, but I didn’t implement it in my attempt.
